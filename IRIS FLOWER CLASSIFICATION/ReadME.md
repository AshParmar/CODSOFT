# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier for IRIS Dataset

## 📜 **Project Overview**
This project involves building and evaluating a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier for the IRIS dataset using Python. The goal is to classify iris flowers into different species based on various features.

## 🚀 **Project Steps**

1. **Data Exploration & Visualization** 🔍
   - Imported the IRIS dataset.
   - Visualized missing values and relationships using heatmaps and pair plots.

2. **Data Preparation** 🧩
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Separated features and target labels.

3. **Model Training** 🏋️‍♂️
   - Implemented a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier with 3 neighbors.
   - Trained the model on the training dataset.

4. **Model Evaluation** 🧪
   - Made predictions on the test dataset.
   - Achieved **100% accuracy** on the test set!
