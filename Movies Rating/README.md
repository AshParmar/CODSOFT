ðŸŽ¬ Movie Rating Prediction Model
Welcome to the Movie Rating Prediction Model project! ðŸš€ This repository contains the code and resources used to build a machine learning model that predicts movie ratings based on various features like Year, Votes, Genre, Director, and Actor. This project was developed as part of my CodSoft Data Science Internship.

Project Overview
In this project, I developed a Linear Regression model to predict the ratings of movies based on historical data. The dataset includes features such as Year of Release, Number of Votes, Genre Mean Ratings, Director Encoded Scores, and Actor Encoded Scores.

Steps Involved:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Handled missing values and transformed data for better analysis.
Converted categorical variables into meaningful numerical features.
Feature Engineering:

Calculated Genre Mean Ratings to give the model insight into how different genres are rated on average.
Encoded Director and Actor ratings based on their historical performance.
Model Training:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Trained a Linear Regression model to predict movie ratings.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the model's performance using the test set and observed the predictions.
