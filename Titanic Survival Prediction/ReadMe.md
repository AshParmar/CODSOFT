Titanic Prediction Model 🚢🔍
About Me 👋
Hi, I'm Ashish Parmar. I'm currently a 2nd-year B.Tech student at GGSIPU. I am passionate about web development 🌐 and am actively learning data science 📊.

Project Overview 🛠️
This project involves building a Titanic prediction model. The goal is to predict passenger survival on the Titanic based on various features. This model utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze and make predictions using the Titanic dataset.

Key Features ✨
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Model Training: Using Logistic Regression to train the model on the processed dataset.
Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using accuracy scores and confusion matrix.
